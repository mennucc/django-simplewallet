django-pursed
===

A simple wallet django app.

### Running

Install docker and docker-compose.

```shell
$ curl -sSL https://get.docker.com
$ pip install docker-compose  # run it as sudo to install it globally.
$ gpasswd -a $USER docker  # add user to docker group
# login/logout from shell
```

Run the project!

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```

Connect to `localhost:8000` , authenticate with username `foobar` and password `barfoo`,
and buy an object.

### Structure

The project is divided in two apps. The most important is `wallet` that manages wallets.
The app `django_pursed` implements a simple shop where the user can buy objects;
its code can be used and adapted to your needs.

### Creating a New Wallet

A wallet is owned by a user. Should you be using a custom
user model, the wallet should still work properly as it
the wallet points to `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`.

```python
from wallet.models import Wallet

# wallets are owned by users.
wallet = user.wallet_set.create()
```

### Operate

The `wallet` model has three methods `deposit`, `withdraw` and `transfer`.
These are low-level methods; in particular, they should be wrapped inside a transaction;
see below for examples.

There are also higher level functions by the same name in `wallet.utils` :
there the user can be specified as `User` class, by username or by email;
groups of users can be specified;
and operations are protected by transactions.

These functions can also be accessed from command line, using the `helper` script.

### Despositing a balance to a wallet

```python
from django.db import transaction

with transaction.atomic():
    # We need to lock the wallet first so that we're sure
    # that nobody modifies the wallet at the same time 
    # we're modifying it.
    wallet = Wallet.select_for_update().get(pk=wallet.id)
    wallet.deposit(100)  # amount
```

### Withdrawing a balance from a wallet

```python
from django.db import transaction

with transaction.atomic():
    # We need to lock the wallet first so that we're sure
    # that nobody modifies the wallet at the same time 
    # we're modifying it.
    wallet = Wallet.select_for_update().get(pk=wallet.id)
    wallet.withdraw(100)  # amount
```

### Withdrawing with an insufficient balance

When a user tries to withdraw from a wallet with an amount
greater than its balance, the transaction raises a
`wallet.errors.InsufficientBalance` error.

```python
# wallet.current_balance  # 50

# This raises an wallet.errors.InsufficentBalance.
wallet.withdraw(100)
```

This error inherits from `django.db.IntegrityError` so that
when it is raised, the whole transaction is automatically
rolled-back.

### Transferring between wallets.

One can transfer a values between wallets. It uses
`withdraw` and `deposit` internally. Should the sending
wallet have an insufficient balance,
`wallet.errors.InsufficientBalance` is raised.

```python
with transaction.atomic():
    wallet = Wallet.select_for_update().get(pk=wallet_id)
    transfer_to_wallet = Wallet.select_for_update().get(pk=transfer_to_wallet_id)
    wallet.transfer(transfer_to_wallet, 100)
```

CURRENCY_STORE_FIELD
---

The `CURRENCY_STORE_FIELD` is a django field class that
contains how the fields should be stored. By default,
it uses `django.models.BigIntegerField`. It was chosen that
way for simplicity - just make cents into your smallest 
unit (0.01 -> 1, 1.00 -> 100).

You can change this to decimal by adding this to your
settings.py:

```python
# settings.py
CURRENCY_STORE_FIELD = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
```

You need to run `./manage.py makemigrations` after that.
